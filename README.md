## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is built primarily as a static site, emphasizing frontend performance and ease of deployment.

**Frontend:**
*   **HTML5:** The core structure of all web pages.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, including responsive design elements (`assests/css/style.css`, `404.css`).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers interactive elements, dynamic content loading, and visual effects (`assests/js/app.js`, `script.js`, `particles.min.js`).

**Tooling & Automation:**
*   **GitHub Actions:** For Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`), ensuring automated testing and deployment of updates.

**Data Storage:**
*   **JSON Files:** For storing dynamic content like `projects.json` and `skills.json`, making content updates straightforward without database interaction.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This is a static web application, so there's no traditional database schema. Instead, content is driven by static JSON files. The core architecture revolves around a robust CI/CD pipeline ensuring smooth deployment.
